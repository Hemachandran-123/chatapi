🧠 Custom AI Chatbot System

This project is a fully functional local AI chatbot that runs seamlessly on your machine — no cloud APIs required!
It combines the power of:

⚙️ FastAPI → Backend API for chat handling

💬 Streamlit → Frontend interface for real-time chat

🧠 Ollama → Local LLMs for natural language generation

🗄️ MySQL + SQLAlchemy → Persistent message storage

The chatbot allows users to interact with a locally hosted model such as gemma3:1b, while logging all user and bot messages into a MySQL database.

🧩 Features

✅ Local inference using Ollama (privacy-friendly)

✅ Real-time chat UI with Streamlit

✅ FastAPI backend serving structured API responses

✅ Message history stored in MySQL using SQLAlchemy ORM

✅ Threaded backend + frontend integration (single-file execution)

✅ Easy to customize for different LLMs or data sources



✨ This isn’t just a project — it’s a reflection of curiosity, consistency, and the drive to turn ideas into impact.
